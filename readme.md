## Introduction

While actively searching in the job market, I felt the need to market my skills & strengths more effectively than what I could through traditional channels.

I managed to fulfill that need through designing, developing and troubleshooting a website that is currently being hosted on heroku. 


## Design & Development

I wanted to learn more about front-end development, as most of my experience has been as a back-end developer. 

Keeping my desire to learn in mind, I created this repository with two submodules - one, with a repository cloned from [Start Bootstrap](https://startbootstrap.com/), and two, a repository cloned from [codeFeed](https://github.com/OneFabric/codeFeed) (a node.js app I started and contribute to).

I modified the the bootstrap template to suit my needs. In addition to adding personalizaed content, I swapped out the PHP-based contact form and used a library that would serve as a mail server. I added my Linked In profile in the footer. 

As for codeFeed, the data from the API endpoint was insufficiently formatted for the purposes of this repository. I wrote a Node.js script that would process the information I got from codeFeed, and format it such that it could be pretty printed in HTML.


## Contributions & Usage

This portfolio is open source and open to contributions! It is ready to deployed to heroku.

Note that other than swapping out my content / personal details / social media links with yours, you will also need to modify codeFeed to ping the github API with your username, and not mine. 

I'm very open to improvements to make, pointers and feedback. I would love to improve this website, both on the front end and the back end, and am very much looking forward to becoming a better designer and developer.
